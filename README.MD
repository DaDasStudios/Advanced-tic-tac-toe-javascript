# Tic Tac Toe in JS
It's the simple tic tac toe game, but made in javascript using lots of cool features.

## Which features does it uses?
Certainly, this game uses a complex CSS hierarchy, for example:
- ::before and ::after elements for x's and o's icons
- :not() pseudo class for hover the inactive cells
- A great setup of the application in the HTML
- Nested-array methods just like *some*, *every*, *forEach*,
- A good separation of the functions that charge every single step of the algorithm
